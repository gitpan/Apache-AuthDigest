Revision history for Perl extension Apache::DigestAPI

0.01  09.06.2002
	- original version
          lots of feeback from Andrew Ho

0.02  09.06.2002
        - fixed bug in AuthDigest.pm where the last
          digest in the password file was returned if
          no user is found

        - fixed AuthDigestFile so that AuthDigest.pm
          actually works, as do the tests (note to
          self: run test suite both with and without
          mod_digest compiled in httpd)

        - minor tweak to (nonpublic) parse_digest_header()

        - never release on friday, especially friday
          mornings before coffee is fully consumed
